            <div class="panel">
                <p>The evolution of AI in programming has progressed from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models that can assist and even generate code. Early AI in programming began in the 1950s with symbolic AI, where logic-based systems like Lisp and Prolog were used to solve problems. The 1980s saw the rise of expert systems, which applied predefined rules to mimic human decision-making.</p>
                <p>With the advent of machine learning in the 2000s, AI became more adaptive, leading to tools like deep learning-based code completion and automated debugging. Modern AI-driven programming assistants, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, leverage large language models to generate, refactor, and optimize code. These advancements have transformed how developers work, making coding more efficient and accessible.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>AI is transforming the role of educators by acting as a teaching assistant, automating tasks and providing support to enhance instruction. Here are five key ways AI is improving teaching:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Grading & Feedback:</strong> AI can assess quizzes, essays, and assignments, providing instant and consistent feedback to students.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesson Planning Assistance:</strong> AI generates lesson plans, learning activities, and curriculum resources tailored to different learning styles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Classroom Engagement Tools:</strong> AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants help answer student queries, freeing up teachers to focus on deeper discussions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-Driven Insights:</strong> AI analyzes student performance data to identify trends, helping educators personalize instruction for better outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By leveraging AI, educators can streamline their workload and enhance the learning experience, making education more effective and personalized. However, privacy can be a major concern as teachers share information that they shouldn't to a tool that isn't safe.</p>

                <p>AI is revolutionizing education by acting as an intelligent learning assistant, providing personalized support and adaptive learning experiences. It helps students improve comprehension, engagement, and efficiency in their learning journey. Here are five key ways AI enhances learning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personalized Learning Paths:</strong> AI analyzes student performance and tailors lessons based on individual strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>24/7 Tutoring Support:</strong> AI-powered chatbots and virtual tutors provide instant explanations and feedback anytime, anywhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Assessments:</strong> AI can evaluate quizzes, assignments, and essays, offering detailed insights and improvement suggestions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language Translation & Accessibility:</strong> AI tools break language barriers and assist students with disabilities by offering text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and real-time translations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code & Writing Assistance:</strong> AI-powered platforms help students write better code, essays, and research papers by suggesting improvements and detecting errors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These AI-driven capabilities are reshaping education, making learning more interactive, efficient, and accessible to students worldwide.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Ethical and Privacy Considerations</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>As AI becomes more integrated into education, it raises critical ethical and privacy concerns that must be addressed. Here are five key considerations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Privacy & Security:</strong> AI systems collect vast amounts of student data, raising concerns about how it is stored, used, and protected from breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bias in AI Algorithms:</strong> AI models can reflect biases from their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in grading, tutoring, or recommendations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student & Teacher Autonomy:</strong> Over-reliance on AI could reduce critical thinking and teaching creativity, making it important to maintain human oversight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency & Accountability:</strong> AI decision-making processes must be transparent, ensuring that students and educators understand how AI-generated recommendations are made.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Use of AI:</strong> Schools must establish clear guidelines on how AI should be used responsibly, preventing misuse such as academic dishonesty or excessive monitoring.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Addressing these concerns ensures AI is used ethically and effectively in education, protecting student rights and maintaining fairness in learning environments.</p>
